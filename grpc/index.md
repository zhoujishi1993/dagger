title: gRPC with Dagger
---

[gRPC] is an open-source RPC framework from Google. Its [Java
library][grpc-java] lets you create RPC servers by implementing interfaces that
are generated from [Protocol Buffer] files, and provides client stub
implementations.

Dagger-gRPC is an extension to [Dagger] that lets you use Dagger to create
applications that use gRPC.

You can use Dagger-gRPC to create [servers](servers.md) or clients [note: client
support is coming soon].

## Call scope

**Call scope** is a scope that lasts for one gRPC call. A gRPC call comprises
one or more request messages and one or more response messages. You can use
[`@CallScope`] to bind objects once for the lifetime of one call. [On the
server](servers#call-scope), bindings in call scope can inject the
[headers][`Metadata`] object for the call.
